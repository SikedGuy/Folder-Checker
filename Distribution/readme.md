Folder Checker

About the Program

The Mod Folder Checker is a Python-based executable designed to help you locate broken mods in your Bonelab directory. Mods often fail to load correctly when placed inside subfolders instead of the main mod directory. This tool scans your mod directory and identifies any mods that are incorrectly structured.

Simply enter your PC username to start the scan.
